Various utility functions are written with clean Haskell implementations.

Notable implementations include:

* A clean solution of a version of the [Countdown Problem] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)#Numbers_round) - see Part B Quesion 6
* A Turing Machine implementation of a palindrome checker - see Part C
